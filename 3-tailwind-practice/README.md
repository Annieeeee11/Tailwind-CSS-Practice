# Cobalt Landing Page - CSS Practice

## Tailwind Concepts Revised

- **`bg-clip-text text-transparent`** - Creates gradient text effect by clipping the background to text and making text transparent, allowing the background gradient to show through

- **`leading-tight`** - Sets tight line height for better text spacing in headings

- **`py`** - Padding on y-axis (top and bottom)

- **`px`** - Padding on x-axis (left and right)

- **`my-20`** - Margin on y-axis (top and bottom). Example: `my-20` adds large vertical margin

- **`mx-auto`** - Centers element horizontally by setting left and right margins to auto

- **`relative`** - Sets position relative, allowing absolute children to be positioned relative to this element

- **`absolute`** - Positions element absolutely relative to nearest positioned ancestor

- **`inset-x-0`** - Sets left and right to 0, useful for full-width elements within a positioned container

- **`h-px`** - Sets height to 1 pixel, commonly used for thin divider lines

- **`flex-1`** - Takes available width/height (flex-grow: 1), allowing element to fill remaining space

- **`focus:outline-none`** - Removes default browser outline on focus

- **`focus:ring-2`** - Adds 2px ring (box shadow) on focus for accessibility

- **`focus:ring-sky-200`** - Sets ring color to light sky blue (creates visible focus indicator)

- **`selection:bg-white`** - Changes background color when text is selected
